# Scripting #

LiteScene allows to run scripts so users can code the behaviour of the application from with in the editor itself.

The info about the scripts can be stored inside the scene so when a new scene is loaded it loads its scripts too.

There are several ways to interact programmatically with LiteScene, every method is better suited for different purposes.

Before delving into the Script component keep in mind that you can create your own components without the need of using the Script component. To know more about it check the [programming components guide](programming_components.md).

## Using Script components ##

The Script component is the easiest way to add behaviour to a project. You can attach a ```Script``` or a ```ScriptFromFile``` component to any node. The difference between both is that ```Script``` stores the code inside the component while ```ScriptFromFile``` references the code from a resource file (better suited when sharing the same behaviour among different nodes or projects).

```ScriptFromFile``` behave as regular ```Script``` but because its load is asynchromous it means their context will be created later in time after the scene has started, keep that in mind (events like start will me called once the node is loaded).

### The script context ###

Every script has its own execution context usually referred as the script context.

The context is created when the component is configured and the code loaded.

When programming inside a ```Script```, the context is the ```this``` of your code:

```javascript
this.foo = 100; //adds a property foo to the script context
```

To access the context of another script component just access the context property throught the component:

```javascript
var node = scene.getNode("mynode");
var script_component = node.getComponent( LS.Script ); //or LS.ScriptFromFile, depending on the component used
script_component.context.foo = 10;
```
Check the section below to know other ways to access a context of another component.

### Global vars of every script ###

Besides all the objects of the system, every script has five globals vars associated to that script:

- **scene**: the scene where the node of this script component is attached, (usually the same as ```LS.GlobalScene``` )
- **node**: the node where this script component is attached, (equivalent to ```component._root``` )
- **component**: the script component itself
- **transform**: the transform of the node where the script is attached
- **globals**: the container shared among all the Scripts, the same as ```LS.Globals```

So feel free to access them from inside your script at any time.

### Local vars and functions ###

Every ```var``` (or ```function```) defined in that scope is local to the context so it cannot be accesed from outside of the scope.

Unless we make it public or we make a setter/getter.

### Public vars ###

If the user wants to make local vars or methods accesible from other scripts, graphs or animation tracks  (or the editor), they need to be made public, to do so they must be attached to the context itself:

```javascript
this.number = 1; //this var will be public
```

Sometimes may be helpful to specify the type of the var to the system, this way the var can be properly connected using Graphs, or animated using Animation Tracks.
In that case the user can use:

```javascript
//to create the var
this.createProperty("myvar", [1,1,1], LS.TYPES.VEC3 );

//to access  it
this.myvar = [10,10,10];
```

Specifying types is important when the types are not basic types, and if you are using WebGLStudio the system will create appropiate widgets to interact with them.

Also, when using WebGLStudio, there is also the option to specify widget properties to have a better UI for this script:

```javascript
this.createProperty("myvar", 0, {type: "number", widget:"slider", min:0, max:100, step:1});
this.createProperty("myvar2", "yes", {type: "string", widget:"combo", values:["yes","no","maybe"]});
```

Or to create even Arrays that can be edited through the editor:

```javascript
//in this case is an array of textures but you can ignore the type if is an array of anything
this.createProperty( "myarray", [], { type: "array", data_type: LS.TYPES.TEXTURE });
```

Or if you want to have a handy button in the component interface when using the editor:

```javascript
this.createAction( "Click me", this.myCallback );
```

There is also the option of using this syntax which is more user friendly:

```js
public var myvar = 10; //for public vars
public var my_texture : Texture = null; //for specific types
public var my_array : [Animation] = []; //for arrays of one specific type
```

but keep in mind that this is just a trick that is replaced by the syntax you have seen before, this means that if you want to access the vars **you still need to specify the scope of the var using ```this```**.

### Private vars ###

Private vars are vars that you don't want to appear in the inspector (but they will be serialized as the public ones).

You can define them passing the widget null, like this:

```js
this.createProperty("myvar", 10, {type: "number", widget:"null" });
```

or using the more user-friendly syntax with the keyword private:

```js
private var myvar : Number = 10;
```

but keep in mind that this is just a trick that is replaced by the syntax you have seen before, this means that if you want to access the vars **you still need to specify the scope of the var using ```this```**.

```js
   this.myvar = 10;
```

### Events ###

To interact with the system, scripts need to attach callbacks to events dispatched by the different elements of the scene, mostly by the scene (but could be the ```LS.Renderer```, the ```LS.ResourcesManager```, etc).
For a better list of execution events check the [events guide](events.md) or if you want events from a component check the specific component documentation.
To bind an event you can call the bind method:

```javascript
this.bind( scene, "update", myfunction );
```

Keep in mind that myfunction must be a public method attached to the context (p.e. ```this.myfunction```), otherwise the system wont be able to remove it automatically.

### API exported methods ###

However, there are some events that scripts usually want to use, like **start**, **init**, **render**, **update** and **finish**.
You do not need to bind (or unbind) those events, the Script component does it automatically when it detects a method in the context with an specific name (depending on the event):

```javascript
this.onUpdate = function(dt) { ... };
```

Here is a list of the automatically binded events, all of them are optional:

- **onDestroy**: called when the script is removed from the node (and no longer belongs to the scene).

- **onConfigure**: triggered after the object has been configured. In case we want to do something else.
- **onSerialize**: triggered if the user wants to store something, must return object with all properties that must be serialized, if this method ins not specified the system stores all the properties attached to the context.
- **onAwake**: triggered after the whole scene has been configured (use it to access other components)
- **onStart**: triggered by scene "start" event, remember that if your script is created after the scene starting you wont receive this.
- **onFinish**: triggered by scene "finish" event, used in the editor when the user stops the play mode.
- **onPrefabReady**: triggered by the node "prefabReady", used to access components or node that come from the prefab
- **onUpdate**: triggered by scene "update" event. it receives the delta time in seconds.
- **onClicked**: triggered by the node "clicked" event. Remember that you need an ```InteractiveController``` in the scene to dispatch this events.
- **onCollectRenderInstances**: triggered by node "collectRenderInstances" event. To pass RenderInstasnces
- **onSceneRender**: triggered by scene "beforeRender" event. Used to prepare stuff before any rendering is done.
- **onRender**: triggered by the node "beforeRenderInstances" event. Used to direct render stuff before the RenderInstances are rendered.
- **onAfterRender**: triggered by the node "afterRenderInstances" event. Used to direct render stuff after the RenderInstances are rendered.
- **onRenderHelpers**: triggered by scene "renderHelpers" event. To direct render stuff related to the editor.
- **onRenderGUI**: triggered by scene "renderGUI", to render stuff in 2D (using the [canvas2D](paint_in_2d.md) or the [LS.GUI](gui.md) ).
- **onEnableFrameContext**: triggered by the scene "enableFrameContext" event. Before rendering the final frame, used to setup a special RenderFrameContext and apply FX to the final image.
- **onShowFrameContext**: triggered by the scene "showFrameContext" event. After the final frame, to show the frame into the viewport.
- **onRemovedFromScene**: called when the node where the script belongs is detached from the scene.
- **onGetResources**: called when the script needs to collect resources. This function receives an object that needs to be filled with the fullpath : type of the resources it uses so they can be automatically loaded when the scene is loaded.
- **onFileDrop**: called if the user drags and drop a file over the scene. Receives and object that contains the file.

Keep in mind that you are free to bind to any events of the system that you want. Just remember to unbind them from the ```onRemovedFromScene``` so no lose binds are left.

### Input ###

You can bind events for actions performed by the user (like mousedown, keydown, etc) or read the input system directly (using the LS.Input object).

Check the [Input guide](input.md) to see more information abour reading the input.

### Serialization ###

Any data attached to the context whose name doesn't start with the character underscore "```_```" will be serialized automatically when storing the scene and restored when the context is created. Keep in mind that when serializing any property it is stored as a base type, so avoid setting public variables of special classes, only store properties of the common types like String, Number, Bool, or Arrays of basic types.

If you want to store stuff that shouldn't be serialized remember to use a name starting with underscore.

### Naming Scripts

If you want to add a name to your script (which could be useful from the editor and to access it remotely), you can add the next line at the beginning of your script:

```javascript
//@my_script_name
``` 

### Accessing other scripts from scripts ###

If you want to access data from the context of another script in the scene (or call a method), first you must retrieve that script context.

To do so the best way is to get the node from the scene, get the script component from that node, and get the context from that component.

```javascript
var node = scene.getNode("nodename");
var component = node.getComponent( LS.Components.Script ); //or ScriptFromFile, depending which component was used
var foo = component.context.foo; //read context property
```

Although you are free to register the components in some global container when the context is created so they are easier to retrieve.

```javascript
//from inside the script you want to make accesible to other scripts
LS.Globals.my_special_script_context = this;
```

### Script considerations ###

When coding scripts for LiteScene there are several things you must take into account:

- Remember to unbind every event you bind, otherwise the editor could have erratic behaviour.
- When using ```LS.Component.Script``` keep in mind that when the context is created (when your global code is executed) if you try to access to the scene tree to retrieve information (like nodes) it is possible that this info is not yet available because it hasnt been parsed yet.
- Scripts only exists if they are attached to a node, when they are detached all the data not serialized will be lost.

## Global Scripts ##

Sometimes we want to create our own Components bypassing the scripts system, this is better because it will have better performance, more control and it will be easier to use by WebGLStudio.

But this scripts must be loaded **before** the scene is loaded. The problem with regular scripts is that they are parsed during the scene construction, this could lead to a ordering problem where a node is created using a component that is not yet defined.

To solve this problem and many others, scenes can include scripts that will be loaded before the scene tree is parsed. This are called global scripts, they are executed in the global context (window) like if they were external scripts, but the files are fetched using the ```LS.ResourcesManager``` (so paths are relative to the resources manager root path unless they are absolute).

The list of all the global scripts is stored in ```scene.global_scripts``` array.

## External Scripts ##

When we just want to load some external library to use in our code we can add it by appending the url to the external scripts array of the scene.

The list of all the external scripts is stored in ```scene.external_scripts``` array.

## Editing LiteScene base code ##

The last option is to add new components to LiteScene by manually creating new component files and adding them to litescene.js.

To do that I will recommend to insert the components inside the components folder of the code structure.

You must add also the path to the component in the deploy_files.txt inside the utils, and run the script pack.sh (to create litescene.js) or build.sh (to create litescene.js and litescene.min.js).

### Missing Components ###

If you have created your own component class from within an script and by any reason when loading a scene the system cannot find the component specified in the JSON of the scene (maybe the component changed its name, or the script wasnt loaded), the data wont be lost an it will be stored aside so it stays in the JSON if you serialize that again.

## Example of Script ##

```js
//@InputController
//defined: component, node, scene, globals

this.moving_speed = 100;
this.rotating_speed = 90;
this.reverse_front = true;

this.onStart = function()
{
}

this.onRenderGUI = function()
{
    LS.GUI.Label([10,10,100,40], "X: " + transform.x.toFixed(2) + " Z: " + transform.z.toFixed(2));
}

this.onUpdate = function(dt)
{
  var x_axis = 0;
  var y_axis = 0;
  
  var gamepad = LS.Input.getGamepad(0);
  if(gamepad)
  {
    x_axis = LS.Input.getGamepadAxis(0,"LX");
    y_axis = LS.Input.getGamepadAxis(0,"LY");
  }
  
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["UP"])
    y_axis -= 1;
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["DOWN"])
    y_axis += 1;
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["LEFT"])
    x_axis -= 1;
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["RIGHT"])
    x_axis += 1;
  
  x_axis = Math.clamp(x_axis,-1,1);
  y_axis = Math.clamp(y_axis,-1,1);
  
  if(this.reverse_front)
    y_axis *= -1;
  
  node.transform.translate(0,0,y_axis * dt * this.moving_speed);
  node.transform.rotateY(-x_axis * dt * this.rotating_speed);
  
	node.scene.refresh();
}

this.onGamepadConnected = function()
{
  console.log("PAD!!!");
}
```
