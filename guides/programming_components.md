# Programming new components

LiteScene is a component based engine. To know more about Components read the [components guide](components.md).

That means that any action performed by the system, like rendering on the screen, adding lights, applying postprocessing effects, 
or executing scripts, comes from one of the many components.

Components are attached to the nodes in the scene to extend the properties of every node, this way the system is very modular and easy to extend.

Although the system comes with many components sometimes you need special features. In that case you have two choices, to create a Script or to code the Component. Scripts are heavier and offer less freedom that regular components and they are not as easy to add as default components.

Check the [Scripting guide](scripting.md) to know how to create Script components and which are their benefits.

If you dont want to rely on Scripts you can create your own components and add them to the components's pool.

# Creating a new Component class

Creating a component is easy, which just a few lines of code you will have your component ready to use,
the complex part is ensure that this component is going to interact propertly with the system, here is a list of common 
steps that you will have to fulfill to create a component:

* Create the **component class** and register it in the system
* Add the **configure** and **serialize** methods in case you want to perform special actions when storing/restoring the state
* Add the ```onAddedToScene``` and ```onRemovedFromScene``` methods to hook the appropiate events with the system
* Define the type or widget information for the public vars, this helps the editor show propper interfaces. Or in the last resort, define the full interface of the component.
* Be sure that any project that uses this component is including the code of this component as an external or global script.

The file containing the code of new components can be included in the HTML, or in the scene using the external_scripts or global_scripts.

## The component class

Lets start by creating a javascript file with a very basic component class.

```javascript
function MyComponent( o )
{
    this.myvar = 1;
    
    if(o)
    	this.configure(o);
}
```

As you can see the component will receive an object as a parameter, this is in case we want the object to restore a previous state,
when thats the case the object will contain all the serialized data. For now we just pass that object to the configure method.

## Base properties

Every component has some important properties and methods by default. They are added to the prototype of the class when it is registered. Here is a list of the properties:

- ```root```: the node where the component is attached (direct access: ```_root```).
- ```scene```: the scene where the root node belongs to (direct access: ```_in_tree```).
- ```uid```: the unique id string, it is autogenerated when attached in case it doesnt have one. (direct access: ```_uid```).

Check the [Component class](https://github.com/jagenjo/litescene.js/blob/master/src/component.js) to see all the methods.


## Adding public variables

Every property of the class is public and can be accessed. If you are working from the WebGLStudio editor then you will see that all properties are exposed in the component interface. To avoid that you should start all the properties with an underscore (```this._internal_data = 10;```) and only use regular names with variables that can be edited.

When creating variables that are editable remember that only some basic types are supported. If the variable has a special type then the editor wont know how to create an interface.

If you want a variable to have an specific editor you can specify it like this:

```js
MyComponent["@mydirection"] = { type: "enum", values: ["north","south","east","south"] };
MyComponent["@profile_pic"] = { type: "resource" };
```

Or if you want to have an specific widget:

```js
MyComponent["@age"] = { widget: "slider", min:1, max:90, step:1, precision:0 };
MyComponent["@gender"] = { widget: "combo", values: ["male","female","other"] };
```

If you are planning to create a custom interface for this component, check the [guide for custom editor interfaces](custom_editor_interfaces.md)

## Registering the component

The next step is to register the component in the system so it can be listed in the components list in the editor.

```javascript
LS.registerComponent( MyComponent );
```

This function is not only registering the component but also adding the mandatory methods to the component that you didn't fill (like serialize, configure).

When a component is registered it checks if the current scene contains this component, and if that is the case it replaces it.


## Adding behaviour 

We have our component but its not doing anything special so we need to add some behaviour.
The best way to add behaviour to a component is binding some functions to specific events triggered by the system (like the render, mouseMove or update events).

When we want to bind an action there are several ways but the most common one is:

```javascript
  LEvent.bind( scene, "update", this.onUpdate, this );
```

Where the first parameter is the instance that will trigger the event, the second the name of the event, the thirth the callback and
the fourth parameter is the instance where you want to execute the callback. You could use mycallback.bind( this ) and skip the fourth parameter but the problem with that approach is that you wont be able to unbind the event in the future (because the Function.bind returns a different function every time), so try to pass always the fourth parameter.

If we want to unbind the event we could call unbind for every event or directly unbindAll to the specific instance:

```javascript
  LEvent.unbindAll( scene, this );
```

When binding events there is an important restriction: **you have to be sure that once this node is no longer attached to the scene (because the node has been removed) your component is no longer doing any action.**.

So when attaching events the best way to do it is using the **onAddedToScene** method in your component:

```javascript
MyComponent.prototype.onAddedToScene = function( scene )
{
  LEvent.bind( scene, "update", this.onUpdate, this );
}
```

And for the opposite, create the method **onRemovedFromScene**:

```javascript
MyComponent.prototype.onRemovedFromScene = function( scene )
{
  LEvent.unbind( scene, "update", this.onUpdate, this );
}
```

If your actions are more related to the node then use the onAddedToNode and onRemovedFromNode.

If you want a list of events follow the [the LS Events list](https://github.com/jagenjo/litescene.js/blob/master/guides/events.md)


## Serializing

Components usually store data that the user can change to control the behaviour, and that data must be persistent so changes done in the scene will be saved.

The system will call the ```serialize``` method of every component to extract the state (if you don't want that this component is persistent you must the ```component.skip_serialize = true;```).
And when the component state is restored it will call the method ```configure``` (or pass it as a first parameter in the constructor).

If the user doesn't define a configure or serialize method the system will create one by default.
This default methods will save any public variable of the component (the ones that doesnt start with an underscore character) and restore its state.

Keep in mind that sometimes you want to do some computations when the component state is retrieved or when the component state is assigned, so define your methods if that is the case.

```javascript
MyComponent.prototype.serialize = function()
{
	return {
		myvar: this.myvar
	};
}

MyComponent.prototype.configure = function(o)
{
	if(o.myvar !== undefined) //we can control if the parameter exist
		this.myvar = o.myvar;
}
```

## Resources used

Usually components use resources that mast be preloaded before the scene starts.

To inform the system which resources are being used by this component you must create the ```getResources``` method in your component.

The function receives an object that contain all the resources already assigned by others components and you must add yours.

The function must fill the resources object assigning the url of the resource equals to the type of the resource (also you can assign them to true if you want).

The function must return the same object as it has been passed to the function.

Check the next example:

```js
MyComponentClass.prototype.getResources = function( res )
{
	if(this.mymesh)
		res[ this.mymesh ] = GL.Mesh;
	return res;
}
```


## Special Events and Actions

Some components could trigger events (p.e. the user has clicked the node) or could be connected to actions (it must play an animation).

To let the editor know which special events and actions can perform a component, you must specify it:

```javascript
//returns which events can trigger this component
MyComponent.prototype.getEvents = function()
{
	return { "start_animation": "event", "end_animation": "event" };
}

//returns which actions can be triggered in this component
MyComponent.prototype.getEventActions = function()
{
	return { "play": "function","pause": "function","stop": "function" };
}
```

## Testing your component in the editor

The problem with our component is that is stored in a javascript file that our editor doesnt load, so there are different ways to force the editor to load new files.

In our case what we are going to do is add the file the external scripts in the Scene settings, to do so go to Scene - Settings and add the URL of the file in the external scripts.
Once the file is loaded you will see your component when clicking the [add Component] button in any node.
If you add the component to a node you also will see that the system has detected that your component has a local variable ( this.myvar )
and has created a tiny interface so you can modify its value.

## Example ##

Here is a basic component that makes the node rotate:

```javascript
function RotateComponent( o )
{
  //define a public variable
  this.speed = 10; 
  
  //call configure if the components recibe a state in the constructor
  if(o) 
    this.configure(o)
}

//specify the widget to show on the editor, otherwise an automatic one will be created
RotateComponent["@speed"] = { widget:"slider", min:-10, max:10 }; 

//we bind the events once this component gets attached to a scene
RotateComponent.prototype.onAddedToScene = function(scene)
{
	LEvent.bind( scene, "update", this.onUpdate, this );
}

//and remove the events once it is detached
RotateComponent.prototype.onRemovedFromScene = function(scene)
{
	LEvent.unbindAll( scene, this );
}

//This will be called every time the update method is launched because we bound it that way
RotateComponent.prototype.onUpdate = function(e,dt)
{
  this._root.transform.rotateY(dt*this.speed);
}

//in this case we dont need to do a serialize method but just to show how it is done
RotateComponent.prototype.serialize = function()
{
	return {
	  speed: this.speed
	 };
}

RotateComponent.prototype.configure = function(o)
{
  if(o.speed !== undefined) //we can control if the parameter exist
    this.speed = o.speed;
}

//Add this component to the components pool in the system
LS.registerComponent( RotateComponent );
```
